      <p> ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Saumojyoti Das, an undergrad B.Tech(CSE) student at ITER college, with a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey is not merely a pursuit of a degree but a passionate exploration of areas of AI and ML. I had the opportunity to work on an
         MLP face recognition project during my internship at Internship Studio,
         contributing to its development and implementation.</p>
 <p>
 My enthusiasm extends beyond the classroom; I actively engage in participating in competitive quizzes, 
 hackathons, and more. In the Common Internship Test, I secured AIR 248. On the other hand,
  I'm know programming languages like Front-end, Python, Java, C, and React JS.</p>
<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I aspire to become a software engineer, combining my skills and
   passion for technology. I enjoy playing online games, watching movies, and exploring new places in the world. Eager to push my boundaries and learn, I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance for creativity and holistic development.
   Looking ahead, I'm excited about the limitless possibilities within the field of computer science. </p>
